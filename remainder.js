//The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers
//Example
let r = 5 % 2; // = 1 b/c
console.log(Math.floor(5 / 2)); // = 2 Quotient, Math.floor() returns the largest integer <= a given number
console.log(2 * 2); // = 4, multiply the second number by the quotient 
console.log(5 - 4); // = 1, subtract original first number by the product of the of the previous equation; 1 is the remainder
console.log(r);
